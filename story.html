      <p>Miss Bandicota Bengalensis was not just any little Indian mole rat. She had magical eyes like no other mole rat and she wanted to see everything. Every night, she packed her explorer's kit: her sunglasses, binoculars,
        magnifying glass and of
        course, her favourite ‚Äì a strip of sticker bandages. ‚ÄúAn explorer is always prepared,‚Äù she said. Every time she dug in a new direction and returned through a new burrow! This time our unlikely explorer has surfaced near the sea. Enjoy a walk
        along the beach with her as she befriends a host of strange creatures.</p>

      <p>As she was fleeing, she looked into the eyes of the mole rat stuck in the trap. Those were the saddest eyes she had ever seen.</p>
